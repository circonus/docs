# Circonus Unified Agent

## Overview

The Circonus Unified Agent, affectionately referred to as CUA [see-you-ey], is an agent for collecting metrics and writing them to the Circonus service.

CUA collects metrics through various input plugins, allowing Circonus customers to monitor systems, services, and 3rd party APIs.

These input plugins are designed to be easy to develop and contribute. Pull requests are very welcome, as we seek to expand support for and incorporate support for many technologies.

CUA is open-source, and its source code is available on GitHub at [circonus-labs/circonus-unified-agent](https://github.com/circonus-labs/circonus-unified-agent).
