# Account Management {#AccountManagement}

From the main menu, there are two administrative areas available.  The first is the administration of your personal profile information. These screens are available from the User Menu icon at the top right of the page.

The second is account management. These screens are listed in the "Account" section of the main menu and are only available to users marked as "Admin" on that account.

## Accessing Your Personal Profile {#AccessingYourPersonalProfile}
Navigation to the personal profile administration screens is available throughout the site from the "User Menu" icon at the top right of the page.

Clicking on this link will navigate to the "User" page. From there, you can manage your personal profile. Refer to the "[Personal Profile Management](/Administration/Profile.md)" section of this manual.


## Accessing Account Management {#AccessingAccountManagement}
The "Profile" link under the "Account" section of the main menu will navigate to the "Account" page. This section will not appear when viewing the main menu in an account for which you are not an Admin.

Refer to the "[Account Management](/Administration/Account.md)" section of this manual, as well as the "[User Management](/Administration/Account/Users.md)" and "[Broker Management](/Administration/Account/BrokerManagement.md)" sections.


## Switching Accounts {#SwitchingAccounts}
Throughout the site, in the upper left corner (next to the Circonus logo), there is an Account navigation link, labeled with the name of the account you are currently viewing.

Clicking on this link will present you with the option to switch the account you are currently viewing.

When switching accounts, the "User" section of the main menu will remain available and access the same personal profile management information as long as you are logged in as the same user.

If you are an Admin for the current account, the "Admin" section of the main menu will appear and allow you to access account management information for the current account.
