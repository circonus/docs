# Release Notes 2020

## 2020-06-01

[EL7 pinned
repo](/circonus/on-premises/installation/installation/#el7-repo):
`baseurl=http://updates.circonus.net/centos/7/release-20200601/x86_64/`

### caql_broker

Version: 0.1.1590667248 (f4a03a2)

* Optional config variable to disable tag_search completely.
* Add configurable queue-size limit to metric_director. Incoming messages will
  be dropped when the queue is full.
* Add `caql-broker-start` script for managed startup.

### data_storage

Related roles: caql_broker, fault_detection, stratcon

Version: 0.1.1590590608 (494fa3c)

**Function Removal Notice**

> Metric Search v2 and Metric Clusters have been deprecated for some time.  We
> plan to remove these deprecated functions soon for the SaaS site, and in the
> subsequent Inside release. This will affect CAQL checks as well as CAQL
> Datapoints on graphs. The UI will now show users a warning when one of the
> deprecated functions is used. Circonus offers a more powerful tag-search
> feature, exposed as `find()` in CAQL.

* Load libmtev ptrace modules for better-annotated crash reporting.
* Change the `/find//active_count` API to use the `count_only` methodology from
  `find` which is faster and more memory efficient, but yields estimates when
  nodes are down.
* Support `__type:(numeric|histogram|text)` in tag searching. Does not support
  pattern matching.
* Add optional `lmdb_flags` attribute to `nntbs` and `metadata` nodes in config
  to allow for better control. Change to drop `MDB_NOMEMINIT` by default as the
  performance implications aren't significant. Drop `MDB_NOSYNC` from the
  default metadata flags.
* Allow nntbs timeshards to recover when bad data is encountered and add
  `.db.nntbs.errors (errors|ST[db-type:nntbs,...])` statistic.
* Move module initialization startup messages out of the error log and into the
  startup log.

### fault_detection

Version (faultd): 0.1.1590695961 (0b8b8e1)

* Fix incorrect assessment of parent rulesets sev 1 state.

Version (ernie): 0.1.1544639627 (db11a23)

**Composite Checks Removal Notice**

  * Fix `-e` flag for running methods other than main.
  * Add `-h` flag for help with a clean exit code.
* Fix eventer JSON output to include timers.
* Tolerate `EPERM` in `epoll_ctl` adding (so adding `/dev/null` doesn't
  assert).
* New ptrace module that enumerates HTTP requests when using `http_observer`.

* Broker: Fix race in check recycle bin, whereby a check that is being restored
  could wind up being deleted instead.
* Broker: Add `filters/show` REST endpoint for getting filterset information.
* Separate counts of dropped messages in `noit_metric_director` to distinguish
  between those that arrived too late from those dropped because the queue was
  full.
  ```

  character, leading to erroneous tag values.

### Web UI/API

Version: 0.1.1589813998 (a392058)

  causing a status code 500 error to be returned if an invalid country code is
  set using the `/account` endpoint.
* fix: Metric search requests which find no results no longer return a 404
  error and instead return an empty result set `[]`.
* fix: Unauthorized PUT requests to the `/account` endpoint no longer return
  the wrong HTTP status code.
* fix: Additional validation takes place on contact group adds/updates for
  pagerduty, opsgenie, victorops, and slack contact groups. These tests prevent
  certain errors from occurring in Bert or other messaging services.
* fix: Empty results are no longer be returned by `/data/fetch` requests when
  the request is for the highcharts data format and includes a reduce
  operation.
* fix: Empty tags values will no longer be returned as null in some objects.
  All objects will now consistently return an empty array `[]` when there is no
  data for the tags field.
* fix: Search query parameters for all endpoints will no longer return an error
  if a numeric query parameter is provided but is an empty value.

### Hooper

Version: 0.1.1586206581 (fe1b966) (EL7, OmniOS)

Version: 0.1.1585315278 (c63b6a8) (EL6)

* (EL7/OmniOS only) `snowth.conf` changes:
  * Add a rollup-suppression tag search filter to the raw database. Any metrics
    having a stream tag of `__rollup:false` will not be rolled up, and will
    disappear from the raw database as time shards are deleted.
  * Turn on `accept_thread` and `fanout` for the 8112 listener. The former
    dedicates a thread to handling new connections, and the latter fans out
    events from accepted connections across threads in the default eventer
    pool. These improve performance.
  * Add a log of RocksDB activity, level "warn" and higher. This will capture
    statistics on compaction, among others. It rotates on file size and will
    not occupy more than 100 MB of total disk space.
  * Explicitly note the surrogate database attribues `cache_init_size` and
    `activity_tracking`, using the in-code default values.
* Remove extraneous blank lines from the `stratcon.conf` template. When the
  application updates its config, these lines are not present, so avoid
  putting them back when Hooper runs.

**Function Removal Notice**

> Metric Search v2 and Metric Clusters have been deprecated for some time.  We
> plan to remove these deprecated functions soon for the SaaS site, and in the
> subsequent Inside release. This will affect CAQL checks as well as CAQL
> Datapoints on graphs. The UI will now show users a warning when one of the
> deprecated functions is used. Circonus offers a more powerful tag-search
> feature, exposed as `find()` in CAQL.

* CAQL: Remove 1y limitation on maximum request span. This limit was added to
  prevent heavy CAQL queries from overloading the system. There are now
  limits on the total number of samples fetched, and timeouts on key
  operations.
* CAQL: Improve performance of all binary operators, by defaulting to
  approximate processing.
* [raw ingestor] Add a `force_jlog` field that will force brokers go through
  jlog, if configured to.

**Composite Checks Removal Notice**

Since the [2019-05-06
release](/circonus/on-premises/changelog/2019#2019-05-06), the `circonus-ernie`
service has remained, serving its secondary role as a broker for [Composite
checks](/circonus/checks/check-types/composite/). This functionality has been
replaced and extended by [CAQL
checks](/circonus/checks/check-types/caql-check/). The Composite check type,
and the supporting service, will be removed in a future release. Operators and
users of composite checks should immediately begin converting to CAQL checks.
Please contact Circonus Support (support@circonus.com) with any questions.

### GoAPI

Related roles: api, web_frontend

Version: 0.6.12

* fix: Issue causing some cache misses not to be recorded correctly.
* fix: Error causing contact group and metric cluster delete requests to always
  return not found errors has been fixed.
* fix: All endpoints that accept JSON data in the request body will now return
  more descriptive errors with the correct HTTP code if the JSON is invalid.
* fix: Improved validation when saving contact group data via the API. The API
  will now check and return errors if contact group type and contact methods
  are mismatched.
* fix: Parsing error that occured during metric by ID lookup with metric name
  containing certain special characters has been corrected.
* fix: Results from the `/acknowledgement` endpoint will always include the
  `notes` and other fields even when they contain no data. Now, they will be
  included with a value of `null`.
* fix: Results from the `/alert` endpoint will always contain the `_cleared_on`
  and `_acknowledgement` fields. Even if they are empty, they will now still be
  included in the results with a value of `null`.
* upd: Changes the auth service process used for token based authentication to
  not use caching by default. Auth token caching can be re-activated with an
  environment variable setting.
* fix: multiple instances where 500 errors were being returned have been fixed
  to return the correct 4XX errors and messaging.
* fix: when using token auth, if either the token or app name header is
  missing, the error code returned will be 401, previously it was incorrectly
  returning code 403 if only one of the headers was missing.
* fix: all endpoints that were returning 404 errors when performing a search
  operation that finds no results will now return `[]` instead of the error.
* fix: bug causing some tag searches for acknowledgement values to fail with a
  non-descriptive 500 error.
* fix: issue resulting in pending auth token application statuses being cached
  and not being correctly updated when the associated application is approved.
* fix: issue causing account/current not to report errors correctly when
  retrieving some types of account data.
* add: new `share_id` parameter supported by the `/data/fetch` and `/caql`
  endpoints. This allows these API endpoints to be used to fetch data for
  shared dashboards, graphs, and worksheets.
* add: new "victorops" contact method supported in the "contact_info" values
  returned by calls to the /user API endpoint. It contains the same VictorOps
  ID that is shown in the User Profile of the UI.

### Hooper

Version: 0.1.1584537406 (b252290) (EL6)

* Facilitate CAQL debugging.
  * Populate the `Snowth::Override` configurations in `circonus.conf`,
    permitting a user to set a UI preference forcing all browser requests to a
    single IRONdb node.
  * Configure the Lua request log on all `data_storage` nodes. This log is

### Reconnoiter

Related roles: broker, caql_broker, data_storage, fault_detection, stratcon, web_stream

Version: 0.1.1584631919 (2fad75d)

* (Broker) Decouple XML culling from check deactivation. This should solve
  issues where removing large numbers of checks performs too much work with the
  master poller lock held.
* Adopt new `mtev_conf_*` section APIs.
* (Broker) Support tagged stats in the broker(selfcheck) module.
* (Broker) Make thread pool selection hierarchical and unify logic. We already
  had check-based thread selection; this expands that to allow for check-based,
  module-based, and module-name-based logic. The `ping_icmp`, `graphite`, and
  `prometheus` checks are updated to use this shared logic.
* Fix crash in socket listener when encoutering an incomplete buffer.
* (Stratcon) Add statistics related to broker jlog feed processing.
* (Broker) Add locking for safety in mtev_hash manipulation by socket
  listeners.
* (Broker) Fix crashes and multi-thread listener. The listener and handler
  shared the same describe function which was incorrect as their closure types
  are different. The opentsdb and graphite modules both registered
  (conflicting) names for the same callback -- wrap them so this isn't an
  issue. Lookup a pool by module name and balance new connections across the
  threads in that pool.

### Web UI/API

Version: 0.1.1584651786 (5992246)

* New Feature: Adds the `/docs` endpoint to GoAPI forwarding to allow public
  access to the GoAPI documentation. Accessible at `https://<api_url_host>/docs`,
  e.g., https://api.circonus.com/docs .
* Bugfix: fix bug preventing the addition of metrics to graphs with the default
  numeric type.

  follow your OS or browser preference, but you may set it explicitly under
  User Preferences.

Version: 0.1.1579636255 (0b6b018)

* Fix: Results from IRONdb are not guaranteed to be in the order requested.
  Ensure that request labels match result labels before returning data to
  original requestor.
* Adds support for `activity` and `latest` query parameters for requests to
  metric search and metric lookup by ID. Also adds the corresponding new fields
  to the result data from `/metric` endpoint requests. The data returned in the
  new `activity` and `latest` fields uses the same JSON formats used by IRONdb.

  currently used only by a script that gets run once during initial Inside
  deployment.

**Function Removal Notice**

> Metric Search v2 and Metric Clusters have been deprecated for some time.
> We plan to remove these deprecated functions on 2020-01-31 for the SaaS site,
> and in the subsequent Inside release on 2020-02-10. This will affect
> CAQL checks as well as CAQL Datapoints on graphs. The UI will now show users
> a warning when one of the deprecated functions is used. Circonus offers a
> more powerful tag-search feature, exposed as `find()` in CAQL.
