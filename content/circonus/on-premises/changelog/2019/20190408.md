# Release Notes: 2019-04-08

## data_storage

Version: 0.1.1554238485 (ba640ea)

* Limit search results to 10,000 items by default. This can be overridden by
  setting a request header, `x-snowth-advisory-limit`, to a positive integer
  value. Setting it to -1 or "none" removes the limit.
* Change default journal replication concurrency from 1 to 4.
* Memory leak and crash fixes.
* Alter search to include check_tags if present.
* Add flag to allow nodes to rebalance in parallel rather than forcing nodes to
  rebalance one at a time.
* Various performance improvements.
* Improved the CAQL label function to support name and tag extraction
* Faster surrogate writes (adding new metrics and updating activity
  information)
* Improve NNTBS timeshard open/close performance by reducing unnecessary
  locking
* Support added for cumulative histograms at read time
* Make rebalance more robust
* Fix crash under repetitive license violations

* Enabled Dynamic Alerting metric_pattern rulesets with regular expression
  matching over one or all checks.

  available metrics to be selectable.

  removed from UI a long time ago.
