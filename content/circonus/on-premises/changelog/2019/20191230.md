# Release Notes: 2019-12-30

[EL7 pinned
repo](https://login.circonus.com/resources/docs/inside/InstallCentos.html#el7-repo):
`baseurl=http://updates.circonus.net/centos/7/release-20191230/x86_64/`

## Operator Note

Circonus has transitioned check tags (those that are associated with an entire
check, rather than stream tags, which are associated with a single metric) from
being stored in the PostgreSQL database to being stored in IRONdb.

Operators are advised to run the following script from the system that serves
the "hub" role in your deployment:

```
/www/bin/checks/migrate_tags_to_snowth.pl
```

This will sync all existing check tags from PostgreSQL to IRONdb.
Depending on the number of checks and tags, this may take a while to run, so
using a terminal multiplexer such as tmux or screen is recommended.  It should
only be necessary to run this script once after updating to the 2019-05-06
release or later, but it will not hurt anything to run it more than once.

**As of the 2019-07-01 release, GoAPI no longer uses the PostgreSQL database
for metric searches, so it is necessary to run this script before updating to
the current release, if you have not already.**

**Function Removal Notice**

> Metric Search v2 and Metric Clusters have been deprecated for some time.
> We plan to remove these deprecated functions on 2020-01-31 for the SaaS site,
> and in the subsequent Inside release on 2020-02-10. This will affect
> CAQL checks as well as CAQL Datapoints on graphs. The UI will now show users
> a warning when one of the deprecated functions is used. Circonus offers a
> more powerful tag-search feature, exposed as `find()` in CAQL.

* CAQL: Fix bug with NULL handling in `window:max` for caql-broker.
* Fix memory leaks in reconstitute.

> tags from Postgres to IRONdb. This is now required to be run in order for
