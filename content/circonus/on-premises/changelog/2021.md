`baseurl=http://updates.circonus.net/centos/7/release-20210322/x86_64/`

### ca

Version: 0.1.1612472455 (ff6ddf6)

* No changes since [2021-02-08](/circonus/on-premises/changelog/2021#2021-02-08)


### caql_broker

Version: 0.1.1615828651 (14a4222)

**Pre-upgrade Notice**

> This release changes the way CAQL metrics are labeled. Previously, if the
> [label](/caql/reference/#labels) function was _not_ used, resulting metrics
> would be named `output[N]`. As of this release, CAQL metrics will be labeled
> based on the computation that led to the particular output.
>
> This can cause the names of existing metrics to change, if no explicit label
> was given in the CAQL expression. **To avoid this, run the following script on
> your "hub" node prior to updating to this release:**
> ```
> /www/bin/inside/label_caql_metrics.pl
> ```
> This will locate active CAQL checks across all accounts that do not have
> explicit labels, and configure them to preserve the existing `output[N]` names.
> It is idempotent, so it is safe to run it multiple times if necessary.

* Increase the size of the negative-match (miss) cache. This tracks metrics
  that are not part of any CAQL checks, to reduce CPU load for evaluation of
  the incoming metric flow.


### data_storage

Related roles: caql_broker, fault_detection, stratcon

Version: 0.1.1616097284 (0872ea8)

**Function Removal Notice**

> Metric Search v2 and Metric Clusters have been deprecated for some time.  We
> plan to remove these deprecated functions soon for the SaaS site, and in the
> subsequent Inside release. This will affect CAQL checks as well as CAQL
> Datapoints on graphs. The UI will now show users a warning when one of the
> deprecated functions is used. Circonus offers a more powerful tag-search
> feature, exposed as `find()` in CAQL.

* Improved web UI performance: the Replication Latency tab now won't update
  unless it's visible.
* Fixes to recovering after an incomplete NNTBS live reconstitute and added
  automatic backup that can be overridden using the optional (`backup=0`)
  parameter.
* Improved error checking and logging for jlog read/write errors.


### fault_detection

Version: 0.1.1616159406 (b6955ca)

* Increase the size of the negative-match (miss) cache. This tracks metrics
  that are not part of any rulesets, to reduce CPU load for evaluation of
  the incoming metric flow.
* Crash fixes in ruleset handling.
* Performance improvements.


### FQ

Related roles: caql_broker, fault_detection, mq, stratcon, web_stream

Version: 0.13.9

* Fix file descriptor leak on connection error.
* Correct usage of `pthread_*` return values. Remove invalid use of `volatile`.

  parameter.

### Hooper

Version: 0.1.1616172883 (5ba95b0)

* The `web_frontend` Apache configuration file is now provided with the
  package, and as such will be kept in sync with the configuration used in the
  Circonus SaaS environment. Changes with this sync:
  * If the `web_frontend` tier is behind a load balancer that adds the
    `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP header, the requesting client's IP will be logged.
    Previously only the load balancer's IP would have been logged.
  * For additional security against click-jacking, the `X-Frame-Options` and
    `Content-Security-Policy` headers will be added, to prevent the site from
    being rendered in a frame or other embedded context
  * Cache-control headers added for additional static assets.


### libmtev

Related roles: broker, caql_broker, data_storage, fault_detection, stratcon, web_stream

* Corrects an error that occurs when metric search operation contain multiple
  terms containing only tag categories and not tag values.
* Corrects how the db.Stats() `wait_duration` metric data is reported.
* Corrects an error with metric search query parsing of search terms containing
  a tag category but not a tag value.
* Allows the `parse_only` query parameter to work using the regular
  `/metric` endpoint.
* Contains goapi implementation of the graph service.
* Query parser errors will now return a 400 status code instead of an incorrect
  500 status code.


### Hooper

Version: 0.1.1609887173 (4921f87)

* **(Breaking change)** Replace the obsolete `nad` host agent with the current
  version of `circonus-agent` on all systems managed by Hooper. The format of
  metrics emitted by circonus-agent has changed, and now uses Stream Tags. Any
  existing checks/rules against nad on these hosts may need to be adjusted or
  replaced.
  * A [reconfiguration run](https://docs.circonus.com/circonus/on-premises/installation/upgrading/#reconfiguration)
    will be required after upgrading Hooper to this version.
* Fix bug in config-check with the `ca` role `primary` attribute.
* stratcon: Enable tuning of timeouts for ingestion into IRONdb. This includes
  both TCP connection timeouts (`connecttimeout`) and overall transaction
  timeout (`timeout`). Values are in milliseconds. Deprecate the previous
  `irondb_put_concurrency` attribute in favor of a new `irondb_tuning` object,
  which can contain any of three keys:
  ```
  "irondb_tuning": {
    "timeout": 8000,
    "connecttimeout": 1000,
    "put_concurrency": 50
  }
  ```
  See [site.json stratcon
attributes](https://docs.circonus.com/circonus/on-premises/installation/installation/#stratcon-attributes)
  for more details.
  Reducing IRONdb timeouts may improve ingestion throughput by allowing
  stratcon to move on more quickly from poorly-performing IRONdb nodes.
  However, setting timeouts too low could negatively impact ingestion as well.


### libmtev

Related roles: broker, caql_broker, data_storage, fault_detection, stratcon, web_stream

Version: 1.12.14

* Fix missing top of crash stacktrace when libunwind is being used.
* Set log message 'SSL layer X not understood' to debug-only if SSL version `X`
  is being explicitly disabled. This reduces logging noise with OpenSSL 1.1.x
  and later.
* Fix `segment_size` and `precommit` config processing for `jlog` logs.
  Previously, application requests to set these parameters could sometimes be
  silently ignored.


### notification

Version: 0.1.1609956725 (b151580)

* Bugfix: Correct handling of maintenance windows, expiration, incoming
  updates.


### Reconnoiter

Related roles: broker, caql_broker, data_storage, fault_detection, stratcon, web_stream

Version: 0.1.1608135246 (4b1e25d)

* (broker) Reopen log files with dropped privileges. This addresses a corner
  case at startup where, if there is a JLog precommit buffer and the last
  available segment is full, a newly created segment will be owned by the wrong
  user.
* (broker) Improved locking around filterset manipulation (crash fix).
* (stratcon) Crash fix in the ingestion pipeline.
* (stratcon) Fix crash when removing a broker that has data submissions in
  flight.


### Web UI/API

Version: 0.1.1616186886 (4d7c104)

* Bugfix: send maintenance window changes to the Notification service.
* Bugfix: correct the Apache proxy forwarding rules to accommodate GoAPI proxy
  requests to Lua CAQL extensions.
* Bugfix: when searching on the Alert History page, it would remove any date
  range filter you had previously selected.
* Bugfix: support for streamtags and non-alphanumeric characters in metric
  names for SNMP and other checks. Also requires broker update to support this
  case.


### web_stream

Version: 0.1.1591797218 (3c0de1a)

* No changes since [2020-06-15](/circonus/on-premises/changelog/2020#2020-06-15)
