**Function Removal Notice**

> Metric Search v2 and Metric Clusters have been deprecated for some time.  We
> plan to remove these deprecated functions soon for the SaaS site, and in the
> subsequent Inside release. This will affect CAQL checks as well as CAQL
> Datapoints on graphs. The UI will now show users a warning when one of the
> deprecated functions is used. Circonus offers a more powerful tag-search
> feature, exposed as `find()` in CAQL.

* Remove debug message that would spam the errorlog when running a
  reconstitute.
* During a rebalance, sending data for an NNTBS shard the destination node is
  not configured to handle no longer crashes the destination node.
* Remove `/hist_shard/reconstitute/surrogate` and
  `/hist_shard/reconstitute/metrics` endpoints.
* Fix bug where extra bad data would be filled in when populating values for
  tag categories.
* Speed up NNTBS reconstitute/rebalance by eliminating unpacking and repacking
  of `nntbs_block_t`.
* Fix bug in rollups where data ingested after a shard has previously rolled up
  could get erroneously deleted.
* Rename `/raw_only_delete` to `/clean_rollup_suppressed_metrics` for clarity.
  This endpoint is primarily for manual debugging and should not typically be
  used by operators.

**Pre-upgrade Notice**

> The 2021-03-22 release changed the way CAQL metrics are labeled. Previously,
> if the [label](/caql/reference/#labels) function was _not_ used, resulting
> metrics would be named `output[N]`. As of the 2021-03-22 release, CAQL
> metrics are labeled based on the computation that led to the particular
> output.
>
> This can cause the names of existing metrics to change, if no explicit label
> was given in the CAQL expression. **To avoid this, run the following script on
> your "hub" node prior to updating if you are on a release earlier than
> 2021-03-22:**
> ```
> /www/bin/inside/label_caql_metrics.pl

  Circonus SaaS environment. Changes with this sync:
  * If the `web_frontend` tier is behind a load balancer that adds the
    `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP header, the requesting client's IP will be logged.
    Previously only the load balancer's IP would have been logged.
  * For additional security against click-jacking, the `X-Frame-Options` and
    `Content-Security-Policy` headers will be added, to prevent the site from
    being rendered in a frame or other embedded context
  * Cache-control headers added for additional static assets.

Version: 0.1.1610656849 (865c4d0)

**Function Removal Notice**

> Metric Search v2 and Metric Clusters have been deprecated for some time.  We
> plan to remove these deprecated functions soon for the SaaS site, and in the
> subsequent Inside release. This will affect CAQL checks as well as CAQL
> Datapoints on graphs. The UI will now show users a warning when one of the
> deprecated functions is used. Circonus offers a more powerful tag-search
> feature, exposed as `find()` in CAQL.

* Improvements to activity tracking accuracy.
* Added optional logging and increased error reporting for raw shard rollups
  and deletes.
* Improve accuracy when compacting metricsdb by accounting for out-of-order
  surrogates arriving.
* `histogram:count*` and `histogram:rate*` CAQL functions now work on
  sub-minute periods.
* `histogram:count*` CAQL functions now return raw counts instead of per-minute
  values.
* `histogram:rate*` CAQL functions now take an option named `period` to specify
  the denominator units (default: per second).
* `histogram:count_bucket` and `histogram:rate_bucket` have been renamed
  `histogram:count_bin` and `histogram:rate_bin`, respectively.
* [raw_ingestor] Performance improvements when sending data to jlog.
* Reconstitute process now pulls activity data from the surrogate db rather
  than relying on raw data to fill it in. This will prevent the possible loss
  of activity data.


### fault_detection

Version: 0.1.1610649467 (13af349)

* Fix erroneously doubled initial absence window on pattern-based rules.

Version: 0.13.5

* Force disconnect on message read/write error.
* Reuse listener threads.
* Various code cleanups.

* Fix BCD integration.


### GoAPI

Related roles: api

Version: 0.8.17

* Changes the way metric search handles category-only v3 search queries, such
  as: `and(component)`. Previously these were sent to IRONdb as:
  `and(component:*)`, now the query will be sent unchanged.
* Corrects an error in metric lookup by ID query creation causing searches for
  metrics containing the `"` character to fail.
* Changes the behavior of CORS headers for the API and proxy servers to match
  the behavior of the Perl API.
* Corrects an error in metric lookup by ID url parsing which caused the `%`
  character to be handled incorrectly.
* Corrects how `/metric` endpoint handles requests with the `count_only` query
  parameter.
* Corrects an issue causing IRONdb proxy error messages to contain unreadable
  messages.
* Fix errors that occur when memcache operations fail.
* Corrects a bug that could cause server panics if no memcache servers were
  assigned in the configuration.
* Fixes an error that would allow certain values to break db queries with the
  order parameter on API search endpoints.
* Corrects an error that occurs when metric search operation contain multiple
  terms containing only tag categories and not tag values.
* Corrects how the db.Stats() `wait_duration` metric data is reported.
* Corrects an error with metric search query parsing of search terms containing
  a tag category but not a tag value.
* Allows the `parse_only` query parameter to work using the regular
  `/metric` endpoint.
* Contains goapi implementation of the graph service.
* Query parser errors will now return a 400 status code instead of an incorrect
  500 status code.


### Hooper

Version: 0.1.1609887173 (4921f87)

* **(Breaking change)** Replace the obsolete `nad` host agent with the current
  version of `circonus-agent` on all systems managed by Hooper. The format of
  metrics emitted by circonus-agent has changed, and now uses Stream Tags. Any
  existing checks/rules against nad on these hosts may need to be adjusted or
  replaced.
  * A [reconfiguration run](https://docs.circonus.com/circonus/on-premises/installation/upgrading/#reconfiguration)
    will be required after upgrading Hooper to this version.
* Fix bug in config-check with the `ca` role `primary` attribute.
* stratcon: Enable tuning of timeouts for ingestion into IRONdb. This includes
  both TCP connection timeouts (`connecttimeout`) and overall transaction
  timeout (`timeout`). Values are in milliseconds. Deprecate the previous
  `irondb_put_concurrency` attribute in favor of a new `irondb_tuning` object,
  which can contain any of three keys:
  ```
  "irondb_tuning": {
    "timeout": 8000,
    "connecttimeout": 1000,
    "put_concurrency": 50
  }
  ```
  See [site.json stratcon
attributes](https://docs.circonus.com/circonus/on-premises/installation/installation/#stratcon-attributes)
  for more details.
  Reducing IRONdb timeouts may improve ingestion throughput by allowing
  stratcon to move on more quickly from poorly-performing IRONdb nodes.
  However, setting timeouts too low could negatively impact ingestion as well.


### libmtev

Related roles: broker, caql_broker, data_storage, fault_detection, stratcon, web_stream

Version: 1.12.14

* Fix missing top of crash stacktrace when libunwind is being used.
* Set log message 'SSL layer X not understood' to debug-only if SSL version `X`
  is being explicitly disabled. This reduces logging noise with OpenSSL 1.1.x
  and later.
* Fix `segment_size` and `precommit` config processing for `jlog` logs.
  Previously, application requests to set these parameters could sometimes be
  silently ignored.


### notification

Version: 0.1.1609956725 (b151580)

* Bugfix: Correct handling of maintenance windows, expiration, incoming
  updates.

  case at startup where, if there is a JLog precommit buffer and the last
  available segment is full, a newly created segment will be owned by the wrong
  user.
* (broker) Improved locking around filterset manipulation (crash fix).
* (stratcon) Crash fix in the ingestion pipeline.
* (stratcon) Fix crash when removing a broker that has data submissions in

  range filter you had previously selected.
* Bugfix: support for streamtags and non-alphanumeric characters in metric
  names for SNMP and other checks. Also requires broker update to support this
  case.
