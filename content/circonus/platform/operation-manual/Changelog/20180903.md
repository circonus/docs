Includes changes since release 2018-08-16

## data\_storage

Version: 0.1.1536172853

* Expose stream tags in search results from the Lua API
* New, optional journal and background job for managing activity tracking
  outside the normal ingest path
* CAQL: new `group_by` function
* Stop statically linking libzfs, always dlopen() if available
* Parse "seconds.milliseconds" from incoming histogram records
* Fix log enable/disable options (-L/-l)
* Replace Lua histogram implementation with one that makes use of the C
  functions from libcircllhist for efficiency.
* Prevent race in the REST delete endpoints
* Add check-wide delete methods for raw and numeric rollup data

## fault\_detection

Version: 0.1.1534363526

* Add flag to disable rule processing

## libmtev

Version: 1.5.4

* Fix `mtev.shared_seq()` producing duplicate keys during startup.
* Add `mtev_cluster_node_get_idx` to get a node's deterministic offset in a
  cluster topology.
* Make `mtev_hash_merge_as_dict` safe for NULL values.
* Fix reported memory leak in DWARF reading.
* Fix race conditions in freeing `mtev_websocket_client_t`.
* Fix race in lua state (mtev lua coroutine) GC.
* Remove local callback latency tracking.
* Add per-pool callback latency tracking.
* Skip epoch reclamation in threads that have never freed anything.
* Always do asynchronous barrier epoch collection from the eventloop.
* Batch asynchronous epoch reclamation to reduce epoch synching.
* Fix lua/ssl\_upgrade eventer actuation.
* Add granular lua garbage collection configuration. default: step 1000
  time before a full collect.
* Monitor process now passes TERM, QUIT, and INT signals to child.
* Fix a bug where we were not always closing the socket/connection in
  `lua_web_resume` - could cause connections to hang.
* Fix a lock contention issue that occurred at startup.
* Fix a memory leak in the lua path.
* Fix some clean targets in the Makefile that were inadequate.
* Move some logging from error log to debug log.
* Fix `gc_full=1` to fire on every invocation as documented.
* Fix asynchronous memory reclamation.
* Protect against attempting to close invalid file descriptors.
* Do proper cleanup of eventer objects, even if not registered.
* Fix internal accounting stats for eventer allocations.
* Don't gate startup of event loops.
* Fix a leak of per-thread Lua closure structs.

## Reconnoiter

Version: 0.1.1536172454

* Change the default behavior of check stats to not be perpetually
  cumulative (and thus potentially memory exhausting).
* Fix null-termination of tags in a Prometheus check
* Avoid null dereference in Lua checks
* Move to new Lua garbage-collection capabilities in libmtev 1.5
* Initiate Lua GC whenever returning from a coroutine
* Fix incorrect initialization function for check stats
* `noit_check_resolver` should protectively initialize

## Web UI/API

Version: 0.1.1536180382

* UI: Fix JS error when sharing a graph.
* UI: Performance fix for check creation stalled when a large number of
  metrics are present.
* UI: Fix bug related to honoring grid preference on worksheet and
  metrics pages.
* UI: Fix bug where a plus (+) character wasn't searchable within a 
  metric name.
