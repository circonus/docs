# Release Notes: 2018-09-25

## data\_storage

Version: 0.1.1537899481

* CAQL: add comparators to the `each` package, which operates on all input
  slots at once: `gt`, `lt`, `geq`, `leq`.
* Fix activity-tracking replication
* Allow 4096 chars for metric name ingestion
* Locking changes for better performance on high-contention locks
* Move raw ingestion startup off of the main eventer thread to prevent
  watchdogs
* CAQL: Remove `wrap_false` from `histogram:*` functions.  Histograms can't be
  missing, they can only be empty.
* CAQL: Map `histogram:*` functions. So that:
  * The case of zero slot arguments is handled correctly
  * We apply the functions to all input slots
* Don't loop forever when journal writes are in the future
* CAQL: Check time during bundle loops
* Disable mtev async core dumps, preventing double crashes (where a "real"
  crash is followed by a second crash due to a database lock still existing)
* Various crash fixes

## Hooper

Version: 0.1.1537455639 (EL7, OmniOS)
Version: 0.1.1536174707 (EL6)

* Remove obsolete `grover_queue*` services. These have not been used in a long
  time.
* (OmniOS) Use a larger ZFS recordsize for `lt-final` dataset in the
  `long_tail_storage` role. This yields better compression ratios.

## libmtev

Version: 1.5.7

* Add the libluajit default path/cpath to luamtev by default
* Fix compressed non-chunked encoding
* Better error on improper rest registration
* Introduce `mtev_watchdog_disable_asynch_core_dump`

* Support `account_id`, `check_{uuid,id}` suppressions
* Support multi-document streaming JSON to httptrap
* Put prometheus module into a dedicated eventer pool
* Support `NOIT_MODULES` environment variable ([PR 493](https://github.com/circonus-labs/reconnoiter/pull/493))

## Web UI/API

Version: 0.1.1537199732

* UI: Fix bug in Quick Graph adding that led to metrics being displayed as inactive

  expression errors on change-metrics dialog
