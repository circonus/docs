# Release Notes: 2019-01-14

## data_storage

Version: 0.1.1546970493 (6cc0c27)

* Fix bug where tagged metrics were not being loaded into the surrogate cache
  at startup correctly.
* Tune the surrogate asynch update journal settings to improve performance.
* Cluster resize tool will use default API port for bootstrap node if not

## GoAPI

Related roles: api, web_frontend

Version: 0.1.1547256603 (a8719ed)

* Bug in search query-building logic affected a small number of cases, now
  fixed.
* Fixes for cookie-based SAML authentication.

## Web UI/API

Version: 0.1.1547226522 (5180b9e)

* API: `remove_rules` option to delete checkbundle has been removed and is
  always considered "on". This means deleting a check bundle or removing a
  broker from a check_bundle (which removes a check) will always remove any
  Alert RuleSets that were dependent on that check/bundle.
* UI: Update the Metrics Explorer and Metric Details pages with support for
  metrics having both numeric and text data (due to having their type switched
  at some point in the past.) For these metrics, the numeric type dropdown will
  allow switching between text data and numeric data.
