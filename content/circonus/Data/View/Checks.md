## Reviewing Checks {#ReviewingChecks}
If you select _Checks_ under the _Integrations_ main menu section, you'll see a grid of all the service integrations we have for data collection. If a service has an _active_ bar it means there's at least one active check in the system of that type.

To search across all checks in your account, use the search bar above the grid on this page. Otherwise, click an integration to view checks of that type.

Clicking _View_ on a specific check will take you to a page of details, including links to [view and edit](/Data/Checks/Edit.md#Navigatingtothecheck) the configuration information for a check or [delete the check](/Data/Checks/Delete.md).
