# Acknowledging Alerts {#AcknowledgingAlerts}

Acknowledging an alert lets others know you are working on the issue.  Acknowledgments also prevent any reminders or escalations from triggering. You may only acknowledge alerts that are currently in an alarm state.  Once an alert clears, the acknowledgment expires with it.

When you are working on an alert, choose "Acknowledge" in the Menu at top right. You can also find this option from the drop-down menu next to an alert's "View" button when viewing the list of alerts.

Next, you will be presented with a dialog with two options:

First, choose for how long you want to acknowledge the alert.  You can use either choose one of a few preset timeframes, or choose "+ Custom Date" to enter a date and time for the acknowledgement, to expire.

Next, you can enter in any notes about the acknowledgement.  These can be viewed from the UI by anyone that might also be looking at the alert.

Click "Ok" and you are done.
