# Advanced Worksheet Controls {#AdvancedWorksheetControls}

Additional layout options for worksheets are available by clicking the Tuner icon next to the Menu button at top right. This will reveal a block-of-boxes icon that, when clicked, opens the Layout Options menu.

## Graph Size {#GraphSize}

There are two options for graph sizes that allow for smaller or larger graph sizes. The number of graphs per row is determined in part by the width of the browser window, and in part by this setting.

## Legends {#Legends}

Selecting 'Show Legends on Hover' will turn on the automatic legend heads-up display when hovering over any of the graphs within a worksheet.  The 'SHIFT' key will alter this state temporarily.  If you have not selected this option, holding shift down while hovering will temporarily display the legend.  If this option is selected, then holding shift down while hovering will temporarily hide the legend.
