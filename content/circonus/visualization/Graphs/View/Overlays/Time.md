# Time Comparison Graph Overlays {#TimeComparisonGraphOverlays}

Under the 'Comparison' section of the graph overlay menu, you can subselect historic views of the current graph relative to the current view window time.

For example, if 1 week prior is selected, then this means that whatever the main graph view's start and end dates, the overlayed graph will be viewing start minus one week to end minus one week.

Several convenient one-click presets are available.  If no preset meets the needs, a variable day entry option is available.
