# Circonus Documentation Project

This repository generates docs.circonus.com. The associated HTML is generated by processing the contributed markdown files through Hugo.

The following Circonus projects are documented here:
* Circonus
* Circonus Broker
* Circonus Agent
* Circonus Cloud Agent
* Circonus Kubernetes Agent
* IRONdb
* CAQL

All source files are contributed as markdown.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

There are several straightforward dependencies to getting this project up and running:
* [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) - A simple static site generator
* [s3deploy](https://github.com/bep/s3deploy) - A simple tool to deploy static websites to Amazon S3
* [GNU Core Utilities](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/) - Often included in Unixlike systems

#### MacOS


On MacOS it is very straightforward to get going. First, install brew:

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Then, install the hugo and s3deploy packages:

```
brew install hugo
```

and

```
brew install s3deploy
```

GNU Core Utilities is available by default on MacOS, so once the above two packages are installed you can run the Makefile.

### Installing

This project can be used as a basic checkout from the GitHub repository. Simply:
```
https://github.com/circonus/docs.git
```

To generate the associate docs HTML, run make from within the project directory:
```
make
```

The above command will create a directory called "public" which contains your generated HTML. Typically users prefer to preview this content in some fashion, to do so:
```
make server
```

## Deployment

The intended deployment environment for the resulting generated HTML is S3. To deploy there, configure the appropriate AWS variables in your Makefile and:
```
make upload
```

Which will push all the contents of the /public directory up to the root of the configured AWS S3 Bucket.
